## Background
You already know about plurality elections, which follow a very simple algorithm for determining the winner of an election: every voter gets one vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins.
But the plurality vote does have some disadvantages. What happens, for instance, in an election with three candidates, and the ballots below are cast?

## Specification
Complete the implementation of runoff.c in such a way that it simulates a runoff election. You should complete the implementations of the vote, tabulate, print_winner, find_min, is_tie, and eliminate functions, and you should not modify anything else in runoff.c (except you may include additional header files, if youâ€™d like).

The function takes arguments voter, rank, and name. If name is a match for the name of a valid candidate, then you should update the global preferences array to indicate that the voter voter has that candidate as their rank preference (where 0 is the first preference, 1 is the second preference, etc.).
If the preference is successfully recorded, the function should return true; the function should return false otherwise (if, for instance, name is not the name of one of the candidates).
You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

The function should update the number of votes each candidate has at this stage in the runoff.
Recall that at each stage in the runoff, every voter effectively votes for their top-preferred candidate who has not already been eliminated.

If any candidate has more than half of the vote, their name should be printed to stdout and the function should return true.
If nobody has won the election yet, the function should return false.

The function should return the minimum vote total for any candidate who is still in the election.

The function takes an argument min, which will be the minimum number of votes that anyone in the election currently has.
The function should return true if every candidate remaining in the election has the same number of votes, and should return false otherwise.

The function takes an argument min, which will be the minimum number of votes that anyone in the election currently has.
The function should eliminate the candidate (or candidates) who have min number of votes.
